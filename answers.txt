What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a repository that is hosted on some Git hosting provider somewhere on the Internet. It often
serves as a central version of a coding project that multiple developers, each with the same project on their machines
in local repositories, can update and receive updates from so that they are on the same page with the rest of their
team. Local repositories are almost always tied to at least one remote repository so that this updating and receiving 
of updates can take place. In this way, remote repositories make it easier for teams of software developers to
collaborate and make progress on a shared project, and they also store the history of this progress for future reference.
