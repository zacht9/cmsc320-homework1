What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Say we have a main branch and a feature branch in our repository. The feature branch split off from the main branch
a while back, and since then, there have been updates to the main branch that it has not incorporated. A merge and a
rebase would both incorporate these new updates into the feature branch, but they would do it in different ways. A
merge would take all of the new updates and add them into the feature branch code, creating one new commit for this
called a merge commit. In other words, this commit would merge the updated main branch code into the feature branch
code. This commit would be added at the end of the feature branch, and the feature branch history would not be
modified in any way besides this. A rebase, on the other hand, would take the new parts of the main branch and place
them in between the old main branch code and the feature branch code. In this way, the feature branch history would
be rewritten to appear linear, and it would appear as though the feature branch has a new base (the new parts of the
main branch rather than the old part), hence the name. However, no new commits are created after the most recent
feature branch commit.

What is a remote repository?

A remote repository is a repository that is hosted on some Git hosting provider somewhere on the Internet. It often
serves as a central version of a coding project that multiple developers, each with the same project on their machines
in local repositories, can update and receive updates from so that they are on the same page with the rest of their
team. Local repositories are almost always tied to at least one remote repository so that this updating and receiving 
of updates can take place. In this way, remote repositories make it easier for teams of software developers to
collaborate and make progress on a shared project, and they also store the history of this progress for future reference.
